      <h2>About Shinjo Kang</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I am Shinjo Kang and I want to be a frond-end developer. Based on
        my background, I believe I would make a great addition to your team.
      </p>

        -DILIGENT & HARD WORKER | As a developer in co-op program, I believe
        that the most important thing is willingness to study hard what I have
        to do so that I can be helpful for the team. I am a very diligent person
        and hard worker. I have worked in trading field in South Korea for more
        than three years. I worked from 8am until 7 ~ 9pm or more every day,
        even though my manager didn’t ask me to work more, because I wanted to
        be a better team member than my coworkers. Due to my hard working, my
        manager really liked me. So, I could get opportunities to work with big
        companies such as Hyundai steel company and Posco. And I could go on a
        business trip to China and Mongolia many times.
      </p>

        -TEAM PLAYER | I am a team player. For three years in the trading
        company, I have learned how to work as a team player. To be a good team
        player, there are two things which are very important. First, I should
        care about how to talk to other team members. Communication is important
        because my words can change other members feeling or mood. Sometimes, I
        could change the office’s atmosphere. Talking shouldn’t be too much or
        too less. Second, I should organize my working data every day so that my
        team members can understand without my explain. When I worked in the
        team, I shared almost every data with my manager. So, I should care
        about many things such as the name of files and folders, the location of
        the data, and sometimes I should memorize some of the content of
        important data. Those are helpful for me to be a good team player. My
        manager and team members love me, so I keep in touch with them even
        though I quitted the job 3 years ago.

        -LOVE TO LEARN A NEW THING | I love learning a new thing and I believe
        that this is important to a developer, because a developer should learn
        a new thing every year. As I mentioned, I was a trader. So, I could get
        the same job in Canada instead of trying to be a developer. I would be
        easier because I have 3 years of experience in the field. But I love new
        technologies. I love using a new machine and a new software. So, I have
        one desktop, one window laptop, one MacBook, one iPad, one android
        phone, one iOS phone and so many machines. Whenever I got new thing, I
        enjoy learning how to use it. So, I know I love learning a new thing.
        So, when I decided to go to college to learn a new major which is
        programming, I knew I could enjoy it.
