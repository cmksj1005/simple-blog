            <h2>About Shinjo Kang</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I am Shinjo Kang and I want to be a frond-end developer.
              Based on my background, I believe I would make a great addition to
              your team.
            </p>
            <p>
              -DILIGENT & HARD WORKER | As a developer in co-op program, I
              believe that the most important thing is willingness to study hard
              what I have to do so that I can be helpful for the team. I am a
              very diligent person and hard worker. I have worked in trading
              field in South Korea for more than three years. I worked from 8am
              until 7 ~ 9pm or more every day, even though my manager didn’t ask
              me to work more, because I wanted to be a better team member than
              my coworkers. Due to my hard working, my manager really liked me.
              So, I could get opportunities to work with big companies such as
              Hyundai steel company and Posco. And I could go on a business trip
              to China and Mongolia many times.
            </p>
            <p>
              -TEAM PLAYER | I am a team player. For three years in the trading
              company, I have learned how to work as a team player. To be a good
              team player, there are two things which are very important. First,
              I should care about how to talk to other team members.
              Communication is important because my words can change other
              members feeling or mood. Sometimes, I could change the office’s
              atmosphere. Talking shouldn’t be too much or too less. Second, I
              should organize my working data every day so that my team members
              can understand without my explain. When I worked in the team, I
              shared almost every data with my manager. So, I should care about
              many things such as the name of files and folders, the location of
              the data, and sometimes I should memorize some of the content of
              important data. Those are helpful for me to be a good team player.
              My manager and team members love me, so I keep in touch with them
              even though I quitted the job 3 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              -LOVE TO LEARN A NEW THING | I love learning a new thing and I
              believe that this is important to a developer, because a developer
              should learn a new thing every year. As I mentioned, I was a
              trader. So, I could get the same job in Canada instead of trying
              to be a developer. I would be easier because I have 3 years of
              experience in the field. But I love new technologies. I love using
              a new machine and a new software. So, I have one desktop, one
              window laptop, one MacBook, one iPad, one android phone, one iOS
              phone and so many machines. Whenever I got new thing, I enjoy
              learning how to use it. So, I know I love learning a new thing.
              So, when I decided to go to college to learn a new major which is
              programming, I knew I could enjoy it.
